# File Access Info

**File Access Info** is a Python script designed to retrieve and display file access information, such as last access time and file ownership details, on both Linux and Windows systems. The script utilizes OS-specific modules to gather this information, making it versatile and suitable for cross-platform environments.

## Features

- Retrieve and display the last access time of a file.
- Display the file owner's user ID (UID) and group ID (GID).
- Convert UID to username and GID to group name (Linux only).
- Cross-platform support: Works on both Linux and Windows.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Linux: `pwd` and `grp` modules (standard in Python on Unix-like systems)
- Windows: `pywin32` package for Windows-specific functionalities (only if using the Windows module)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mahdikhoshdel/file-access-info.git
   cd file-access-info
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages:**

   - For Linux: No additional installation is required.
   - For Windows (if you plan to test on Windows):

     ```bash
     pip install pywin32
     ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Script:**

   Use the following command to run the script, specifying the file path you want to check:

   ```bash
   python file_access_info.py /path/to/your/file
   ```

2. **Command-Line Argument:**

   The script accepts a file path as a command-line argument:

   ```bash
   python file_access_info.py /path/to/your/file
   ```

   Example for Linux:

   ```bash
   python file_access_info.py /home/user/documents/example.txt
   ```

   Example for Windows:

   ```bash
   python file_access_info.py C:\Users\User\Documents\example.txt
   ```

## Project Structure

```

```

- `main.py`: Main script to run the project.
- `linux.py`: Module containing Linux-specific file access logic.
- `windows.py`: Module containing Windows-specific file access logic.

## Examples

To check the access information of a file on a Linux system:

```bash
python file_access_info.py /home/user/sample.txt
```

Output:

```
Last Access Time: Wed Aug 23 13:00:00 2023
File Owner UID: 1000 (Username: user)
File Owner GID: 1000 (Group Name: usergroup)
```

### Notes:

- Replace `https://github.com/yourusername/file-access-info.git` with the actual URL of your repository.
- The README assumes you have a script called `file_access_info.py` as the main entry point and that your Linux-specific logic is in `linux.py`, while Windows logic is in `windows.py`.
- Modify the sections as per your actual project setup and folder structure.
- Make sure to update the `LICENSE` file if you are using a different license.

This README will provide users with a clear understanding of your project's purpose, setup instructions, and usage examples, making it easier for them to get started and contribute.
